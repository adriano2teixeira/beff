from:

        export default {
            "/hello": {
                get: (): {a:string, b: boolean} => todo()
            }
        }
        
to:

        export default {
            "/hello": {
                get: (): {a:string, b?: boolean} => todo()
            }
        }
        

# Error at GET /hello:

Response body is not compatible.

```ts
type Old = {
    "a": string;
    "b": boolean;
};
```

```ts
type New = {
    "a": string;
    "b"?: boolean;
};
```

```ts
type Diff = ({
    "a": string;
    "b"?: boolean;
} & Not<{
    "a": string;
    "b": boolean;
}>);
```

Previous clients will not support this potential response:

```js
{
    "a": "abc",
    "b": undefined
};
```

diff:

```js
{
    "a": never(),
    "b": undefined
};
```

evidence:

```js
{
    "a": "abc",
    "b": undefined
};
```
