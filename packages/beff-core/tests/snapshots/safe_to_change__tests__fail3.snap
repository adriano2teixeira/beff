# Error at GET /hello:

Response body is not compatible.

```ts
type Old = Array<("a" | "b")>;
```

```ts
type New = Array<("a" | "b" | "c")>;
```

```ts
type Diff = (Array<("a" | "b" | "c")> & Not<Array<("a" | "b")>>);
```

```ts
type Evidence = Array<("c")>;
```

Previous clients will not support this potential response:

evidence:

```js
[
    "c"
];
```
