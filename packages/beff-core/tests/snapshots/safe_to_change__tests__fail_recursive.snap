# Error at GET /hello:

Response body is not compatible.

```ts
type New = BObject;
```

```ts
type Old = AObject;
```

Previous clients will not support this potential response:

```js
{
    "arr": [
        {
            "arr": [
                recursion()
            ],
            "p": true,
            "p2": "abc"
        }
    ],
    "p": true,
    "p2": "abc"
};
```
