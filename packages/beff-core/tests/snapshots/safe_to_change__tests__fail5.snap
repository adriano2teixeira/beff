from:

        export default {
            "/hello": {
                get: (): {p:"a"|"b"} => todo()
            }
        }
        
to:

        export default {
            "/hello": {
                get: (): {p:"a"|"b"|"c"} => todo()
            }
        }
        

# Error at GET /hello:

Response body is not compatible.

```ts
type Old = {
    "p": ("a" | "b");
};
```

```ts
type New = {
    "p": ("a" | "b" | "c");
};
```

```ts
type Diff = {
    "p": "c";
};
```

Previous clients will not support this potential response:

```js
{
    "p": "c"
};
```
